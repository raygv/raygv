- Hi, I’m Ray
- I’m interested in programming and applying this to machine learning.
- I’m currently learning about circuits and some machine learning in my VIP project.
- I'm originally from the Philippines, but I've lived on O'ahu since I was 8 years old.
- I'm a sophomore in electrical engineering.
- I chose my major because I thought dealing with things that you can't see, like signals, was interesting.
- A fun fact about me is:  I like running.
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  I want to learn how to become a better programmer and how to learn faster.
- A book or movie I'd recommend is:  Interstellar
